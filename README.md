# tv-renamer

Uses the Trakt api (**API token required**) to scan a directory of your choice for tv episodes.
Uses Python's built in string formatting to rename files.

Path scrubbing thanks to [Flexget](https://github.com/Flexget/Flexget).

## Todo:
* get logging in place
* handle errors better
* refactor some
